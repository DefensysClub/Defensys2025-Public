**Description**:  Alice and Bob have been talking for a while lately and Eve got jealous so she took Alice's laptop and throw it in the lake and now all Bob's messages are lost for ever, but little did Eve know that Bob is a forensics expert and he extracted Alice's private key, now Alice can decrypt his messages
Right, Right ? 

**What this challenge is about**: extract n from the public key, and partial p from the corrupted private key, and find the remaining bits of p using coppersmith, then decrypt the flag
